<h2 id="sec-1">Burr Metadata Framework Overview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It's been called the Great Conversation; a global cocktail party where
everyone is talking at the same time. The Web is a vast slurry of
content and services.  It works especially well for new content
because services like Google, Digg and YouTube help popular content to
bubble to the surface. It's a bit like throwing pasta at a wall. If
content is ready for prime time it sticks, if not, more often than
not, it falls.  But not all content that has value is either new or
popular. And when that content stops sticking to the wall it sinks to
the bottom of the slurry and much of it is eventually lost forever.
</p>

<p>
Until recently such content was published on physical media, collected
and cataloged into libraries and archives so that it would be
preserved and accessed in the future. But today nearly all content is
created in native digital formats and increasingly never makes it onto
physical formats at all. The Web is not designed institutionally or
technologically to perform the same role that brick and mortar
Libraries and archives have in the past.
</p>

<p>
This is the role that the Burr Metadata Framework (BMF) has been
designed to fill.
</p>

<p>
BMF provides a framework for building structured, distributed, indexed
collections of content. Pages/ records are linked to each other using
<b>defined-by</b> links which point to records which define things.
Collections are organized by defining the relationship (e.g.. broader,
narrower, related, equivalent etc) that the concept the record
represents with other concepts represented by other records. BMF uses
a distributed architecture and works much the same way as distributed
version control systems like Git and Arch.  Client software downloads
records and content from other collections and weaves them into a
local collection by dynamically generating indexes of backlinks
(similar to the way Google indexes Web content for their search
engine).
</p>

<p>
The approach BMF uses has a number of advantages and features which
are worth mentioning:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interoperability is as simple as defining the relationships
between concepts represented by records.
</li>
<li>Multiple copies of content are kept in multiple locations, ensuring
that content is not corrupted or lost.
</li>
<li>Indexing is distributed and local rather than provided solely by
centralized third-party search services like Google.
</li>
<li>Context (the who, what, when, where associated far down the Long
Tail.  with content) is preserved, which is especially important
for older and less accessed content located
</li>
<li>Simply using a collection adds greater value to it over time as
gaps in records refined, gaps filled, new relationships are
established and indexes become increasingly fine grained.
</li>
<li>Collections can be mirrors of other collections or a union of
subsets of content from any number of other
collections. Collections can be established for a variety of
purposes including long term archival storage of master formats,
public libraries providing content converted into popular formats,
or personal working libraries made up of working formats used by
software used for creating or editing content.
</li>
<li>A globally unique ID system is integrated with a RESTful URI
syntax which can be used for identification, defining complex
queries, retrieval of and automated conversion of content into
different formats and encodings.
</li>
<li>Fine-grained access control used a federated identity system based
on OpenID which allows multiple role to be defined which are
associated with the identity of an individual, or corporate body.
</li>
<li>Collections are designed to scale from small personal collections
that could fit on an iPhone up to distributed superclusters of
servers as large as the Googleplex.
</li>
<li>Leverages the smart data structures so that relatively dumb and
cheap applications can be used to process them. This is in
contrast with the World Wide Web which requires smart and
expensive applications to spider, index and search it.
</li>
<li>Just as Cascading Style Sheets were designed to separate
presentation from structure, BMF is designed to separate semantic
markup from its structure This is done by defining extensible
globally interoperable distributed catalog languages rather than
monolithic global subject and authority catalogs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
BMF has been in development for over a decade. It has been chosen
for use in three large scale archival projects which are in now in
early stages of development. Documentation, technical specifications
and schemas are being completed now in preparation for submitting BMF
to an open standards body in fourth quarter 2009.
