<p>
Since the Mekong River is such a pervasive image and theme running
through many of Chenla's projects, I thought it might be good, from
time to time, to post news relating to the river itself.
</p>

<p>
According to Winai Chintongprasert, head of the Chiang Saen
customhouse, the river, which forms the border of Thailand with
Laos and Cambodia, and Laos with China, has run completely dry,
with a very long line of sand dune islands in the middle of the
river, forcing freighters from Thailand’s Chiang Saen Port to
China’s Guanlei Port in Yunnan province and vice versa to have
halted their runs for over 10 days.
</p>

<p>
Water levels are historically low partially because of an extended
drought which has effected the region for the last few years.  But
another important factor are the many Dam projects along the Mekong in
China.  
</p>

<p>
Seventeen dams have been built on the Mekong River, most of which are
in China.  These dams are threatening fisheries, destroying a vast
ecosystem, and starving millions.  An additional eleven dams are
currently in the planning process.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.mrcmekong.org/">Mekong River Commission</a> was established as an international body
to help protect and preserve the river as a shared resource for all of
the countries it passes through.  Not surprisingly, the only country
not to have joined the commission is China.
