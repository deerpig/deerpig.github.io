<p>
The following is a draft of a section of a chapter introducing our
Universal Authority Control project which is at the core of all Chenla
Content projects.  Any feedback would be most welcome.

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Organization as a Human Activity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In recent years it has become common to hear the claim that search
engines will replace the need to catalog altogether.  But what many
people don't understand is that search and retrieval is only a small
part of why we catalog. But search engines do not replace cataloging
or authority records and it's doubtful they ever could.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Search Engines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Search engines are nothing short of a technological wonder; a human
achievement that should be mentioned in the same breath as landing a
man on the moon, or any of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I am a heavy user of search engines.  As I write this, I
personally have made 13,202 searches since September 2004 when I first
got my Gmail account, and this only includes searches made while I was
logged into Google!
</p>

<p>
Search engines are very good at finding new and popular content, at
the head on the left side of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail">Long Tail</a>.  But as you move
down the tail, keyword search becomes less and less useful as the
content becomes older and less popular.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Cataloging as an Organizational Technique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Cataloging, on the other hand is nothing more or less than a technique
for the organization of objects and information.  It is true that one
of the primary reasons we organize, is so that we can find things, but
just as importantly, we organize to understand things as well.
</p>

<p>
Organization is not simply a matter of sorting and collating, it also
requires that we categorize, which means identifying the similarity
between different things, as well as to evaluate the worth of items so
that they may be either preserved, consolidated or discarded.
</p>

<p>
As we categorize and organize we can then begin to see larger patterns
and trends emerge and we can use the categories used to catalog as
mental signposts to remember not only where things are stored, but as
a means of associating new information and content as we come across
it in our daily lives.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Chunking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In cognitive psychology and linguistic analysis this process is called
chunking.  The term is used to indicate long-term memory structures
that can be used as units of perception and meaning as a way the human
brain organizes memories, and concepts.  In a sense, cataloging is a
means externalization and collectively sharing with others either
locally or remotely, in real time and in the future, the same process
we use to remember and understand the world around us that is going on
in our brains.
</p>

<p>
In other words, cataloging is a a very human activity which is a
fundamental part of our daily lives both as members of a culture and
society and as individuals.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Controlled Vocabularies &amp; Folksonomies</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In addition to controlled vocabularies and thesauri I would be remiss
not to mention folksonomies which are more popularly known as <i>tags</i>
or <i>tagging</i> that used by many popular web services like Flickr or
Del.icio.us.
</p>

<p>
This isn't the place to get into the religious wars between the
taggers and those who prefer controlled vocabularies beyond that the
two are not mutually exclusive.  
</p>

<p>
Folksonomies are quick and easy and require no formal training.
Adding a tag costs very little in time or effort and for that reason
they are ideal means of a quick and dirty first pass cataloging for
new content.  
</p>

<p>
Controlled vocabularies are expensive and difficult to implement, but
provide a mechanism for disambiguation between similar or alternate
terms for the same person, place or concept, and provide a means for
establishing a relationship between each term and other broader,
narrower, related or equivalent terms.  So a controlled vocabulary is
ideal for older content that has already been identified as having
some sort of long term value and therefore justifies the cost of
cataloging using a controlled vocabulary.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Beyond a Search &amp; Retrieval Based Web</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
The Web and more recently, the Social Web has transformed the way we
communicate and interact with each other.  But we are still managing
the way we collect and organize information in two ways, 1) using file
names and directories (folders) in a file system; and 2) using closed
data structures which are hard coded into applications on the desktop
and web applications.
</p>

<p>
There is no way of knowing what a post-search Web would look like.  It
is clear though that it will likely include a new paradigm for how
people and groups collect, organize and manage their own information
and mesh their own data structures with the data structures or other
people and groups.
