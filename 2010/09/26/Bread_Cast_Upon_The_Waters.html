I have been thinking a great deal about how to build organizations and
institutions which can survive very long periods of time.  But how do
you justify such investments, especially to a generation the measures
time in nano-seconds and measures success by the ROI in the next
financial quarter?
</p>

<p>
In a fairly recent SALT (Seminars About Longterm Thinking) by the Long
Now Foundation entitled <a href="http://www.longnow.org/seminars/02010/feb/01/long-finance-enduring-value-conference/">Long Finance</a>, Stewart Brand read out an
extended quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_for_the_Stars">Time for the Stars</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the book, the <b>Long Range Foundation</b> take on very long term goals
which require such vast amounts of both time and money that from a
near-term perspective they are pointless wastes of money.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We got interested in the purposes of the Long Range
Foundation. Its coat of arms reads: "Bread Cast Upon the
Waters," and its charter is headed: "Dedicated to the
Welfare of Our Descendants." The charter goes on with a lot
of lawyers' fog but the way the directors have interpreted
it has been to spend money only on things that no government
and no other corporation would touch. It wasn't enough for a
proposed project to be interesting to science or socially
desirable; it also had to be so horribly expensive that no
one else would touch it and the prospective results had to
lie so far in the future that it could not be justified to
taxpayers or shareholders. To make the LRF directors light
up with enthusiasm you had to suggest something that cost a
billion or more and probably wouldn't show results for ten
generations, if ever&#x2026;something like how to control the
weather (they're working on that) or where does your lap go
when you stand up.
</p>

<p>
The funny thing is that bread cast upon waters does come
back seven hundred fold; the most preposterous projects made
the LRF embarrassing amounts of money &#x2013; "embarrassing" to a
non-profit corporation that is. Take space travel: it seemed
tailor-made, back a couple of hundred years ago, for LRF,
since it was fantastically expensive and offered no probable
results comparable with the investment: There was a time
when governments did some work on it for military reasons,
but the Concord of Bayreuth in 1980 put a stop even to that.
</p>

<p>
So the Long Range Foundation stepped in and happily began
wasting money. It came at a time when the corporation
unfortunately had made a few billions on the Thompson
mass-converter when they had expected to spend at least a
century on pure research; since they could not declare a
dividend (no stockholders), they had to get rid of the money
somehow and space travel looked like a rat hole to pour it
down.
</p>

<p>
Even the kids know what happened to that: Ortega's torch
made space travel inside the solar system cheap, fast, and
easy, and the one-way energy screen made colonization
practical and profitable; the LRF could not unload fast
enough to keep from making lots more money.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <b>Long Range Foundation</b> projects echos a number of
themes found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report_from_Iron_Mountain">Report From Iron Mountain</a> (<a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/iron_mountain_full.htm">full text of
the book</a>); a hoax or satire (take your pick) published in
1966 by the Dial Press which claimed to be a leaked
government report from a government think tank exploring the
consequences of long term peace.
</p>

<p>
I was given a copy of the book around 1978 during a lazy
summer in a century old Pennsylvania farmhouse by the wife
of a retired vice-president of Harvard University turned
gentleman farmer.  The ideas explored in the book stuck in
my head, unresolved, ever since.
</p>

<p>
Philip Coppens wrote a excellent <a href="http://www.philipcoppens.com/ironmountain.html">article</a> on <b>The Report From
Iron Mountain</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Lewin proposed that until substitutes for war were
developed, “war” needed to be maintained, if not improved in
effectiveness. Part of the “genius” of Lewin is in the type
of proposed potential substitutes he proposed – some of
which may have given various governments some inspiration…
or is it just coincidence that “reality” mimics fiction? The
Report’s recommendations were:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a giant space-research programme whose goal was largely
impossible to achieve (a black hole, budget-wise and
hence able to feed the economy);
</li>
<li>create a new, non-human enemy, e.g. the potential
threat of an extra-terrestrial civilisation
</li>
<li>create a new threat to Mankind, e.g. pollution
</li>
<li>new ways of limiting births, e.g. via adding drugs to
food or water supply
</li>
<li>create fictitious alternate enemies
</li>
<li>create an omnipresent, virtually omnipotent
international police force.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many of these proposals should feel uncomfortably familiar.
When the cold war ended, new phantom enemies were erected
including the <i>War on Drugs</i> and the <i>War on Terror</i>.  These
were not real Wars.  They had no concrete objectives and no
means of ever being concluded.  But so long as they could be
used to create fear, they justified the existence of the
Nation State and the vast sums of money being thrown away to
fight them.
</p>

<p>
The Nation State, as we've known since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a>,
is on it's way out.  Finance, Transportation, Energy and
Communications are now global distributed networks which
transcend the ability of any one Nation State to control.
Pretty much all services that Nation States provide can be
delivered by either local government or the private sector.
Over the next decades all that the Nation State will have
left to offer their citizens is the threat of physical
force and the military industrial complex that Eisenhower
warned of in his <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eisenhower's_farewell_address">farewell address</a> in January 1961:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States
had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares
could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But
now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of
national defense. We have been compelled to create a
permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to
this, three and a half million men and women are directly
engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on
military security alone more than the net income of all
United States corporations.
</p>

<p>
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new in the American
experience. The total influence &#x2013; economic, political, even
spiritual &#x2013;is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every
office of the Federal government. We recognize the
imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail
to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources,
and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of
our society.
</p>

<p>
In the councils of government, we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential
for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
persist. We must never let the weight of this combination
endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should
take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable
citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge
industrial and military machinery of defense with our
peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may
prosper together.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The purpose of the <b>Long Range Foundation</b> seems, on the
surface, to be much the same as Lewin's proposals to dump
huge amounts of money into projects which will have no
practical return on investment.  But in fact, as Heinlein
points out, the ROI from such projects is potentially
enormous.  Where war truly is a means of throwing away
money, big projects seeking to solve big ideas will often
lead to very substantial payoffs.  Just not for the
generation which initiates them.
</p>

<p>
This is a message that needs to be relearned.  We need to
make the distinction between investment whose only purpose
is to prop up power structures that are reaching the end of
their shelf life and big investments in the future that have
a real payoff.  This could form the foundation for a 
Nation State which is not based on fear and phantom enemies.
</p>

<p>
Some things take time.  Sometimes a very long time.  But the
potential payoff that your grandchildren or perhaps great
great great grandchildren will see is very real.  And it is
our responsibility to lay the groundwork for those who come
after we as individuals have passed out of living memory.
Bread cast upon the waters indeed.
