"Yes, sir," Benjamin said.

"Are you listening?" McGuire said.

<p>
The human mind is a pattern recognition machine.  The brain
relentlessly takes in sensory input, and matches that input against
memories and then makes a mental model that fits the sensory input
into that mental model.  The result, which is the illusion our brain
creates, is a best guess at what the world is.
</p>

<p>
So long as the brain can relate new input with existing memories,
analogies and metaphors, it does a pretty good job of understanding
the world around us. But it's far more conjecture than we realise.
</p>

<p>
For example, the actual area that the human eye can see clearly is
actually very small.  But as the eye scans a room, the brain builds up
a composit image that we think is much larger.  But in fact it is a
mental model that is made up of more of short term memories than what
it is really seeing at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
The brain is constantly doing this.  When you walk into a room you
have never been in before, your mind makes assumptions about that room
that are not supported by any direct evidence.  We assume, on past
experience that when we see a wall, there will be either another room,
or outside of the building there.  If you are in a submarine the brain
will assume that there is water on the otherside of a wall, or another
compartment. 
</p>

<p>
This is far from being a perfect system, and the mental models that
the brain generate are often wrong.  The brain is driven to constantly
and relentlessly look for patterns that can be added into a mental
model.  And when there is insufficient information, the mental model
is influenced by what you <i>want</i> to see.  If you are in a lifeboat
scanning the horizon or sky for rescue, a chance reflection, or shadow
will often be briefly percieved as a plane or boat.  People who have
very deeply held ideological and religious belief systems will often
take false possitive matches as evidence for building a mental model
that believes that they have actually seen things that in fact were
never there.
</p>

<p>
But this problem is not the sole domain of people who have seen Elvis
or Jesus in a grapefruit.  Humans have a very real limit on the amount
of change that they can incorporate into their mental model of the
world at any given moment.  If that change requires a person to set
aside set beliefs, the brain rebels and refuses to accept the evidence
before it.  People can only change so much in a lifetime after they
have reached a certain age.  And once you've hit that limit, you've
lost the ability to adapt.
</p>

<p>
As Alvin and Heidi Toffler have argued since their ground breaking
book Future Shock was published in 1970, the rate that things are
changing is increasingly exponentially.  But the human brain, which is
designed for life as hunter-gather species living on the African
Savannah, has to cope with a world that changes more in a year than
it's ancient ancestors would have to cope with in a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
It takes us time to internalize new ideas and concepts.  And if a new
idea is replaced with another idea before a person has had time to
internalize it, they will be left behind and stuck trying to use an
outmoded model of the world around them to understand a world that is
diverging further and further from their own internal mental model.
</p>

<p>
William Gibson said that "the future is here, it's just not evenly
distributed."  The Toffler's divide human development into three broad
stages, the first was was agricultural, the second was industrial, and
the third is based on information, and I would add, networking.  The
agricultural revolution is still alive and well in various remote
locations on the planet, and certainly the industrial revolution is in
progress in the developing world.  The post-industrial
information-networking revolution has really only taken hold in
highly developed areas of the planet in the last twenty years.  Within
each of these revolutions are many sub-stages of development.  The
agracultural revolution lasted milennia.  The industrial revolution
took place over hundreds of years.  But the same amount of change that
was spread over the industrial revolution has been compacted down into
less than a single lifetime, and we are still in the early stages of
the process.

<p>
So what is the process that we first understand something that is new,
and then internalize it into our mental model?
</p>

<p>
Understanding all about context.  There can be communcation between
two parties unless they share a certain amount of information.  That
includes not only language, but cultural, economic and technological
assumptions about the world around them.  If you don't understand the
context that the person you are communicating with, there can be no
understanding and no communication will take place.
</p>

<p>
So when a person is confronted with something they don't understand
they first try to match what they see with something that they do
understand, even if they are very different things.
</p>

<p>
A common way of doing this is through the use of metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Technology has largely only found mass acceptance when a suitable
metaphor has been created that give people a cognitive foot hold they
can use to understand it.
</p>

<p>
People used a graphical display that had a <i>desktop</i> where you could
arrange different things on your computer in the same way you would
arrange paper, books and tools on your desk.  If you wanted to throw
something away, you deleted it by moving it into a <i>trash can</i>.
Windows were closer to pieces of paper or books that could be moved
around and placed on top of each other.
</p>

<p>
The Microsoft Office productivitiy suite of applications was a perfect
example of this.  A word processor, was an electronic type writer.  A
spreadsheet was a ledger book.  Outlook, used for email, was the
postal system, with an inbox and outbox, and letters that were
addressed to reciepients like memos in an office.  The presentation
software was foamcore on an easel &#x2013; or slides projected from a slide
projector.  These were metaphors that the general public could
understand.
</p>

<p>
When the Internet came along, it didn't take off until the World Wide
Web made it possible to introduce a whole new set of metaphors.  A web
site was like a storefront, or book, or magazine or catalog or
newspaper.  Yahoo didn't start as a search engine, but an online
directory of web sites like the Yellow Pages.
</p>

<p>
Search never really had a proper metaphor linking it to the analog
world, but it wasn't able to really take off until people had
internalized the concepts behind software, operating systems and the
web before they could internalize it.
</p>

<p>
The same happened with Social Media.  The metaphors behind social
media were the Bulletin Board, a part of a wall where one could pin
notes, ads and pictures for other people to see.  The other metaphor
was the mailing list &#x2013; which you subscribed to and sent email to and
copies would then be sent to every one that had subscribed.
</p>

<p>
But there are only so many metaphors that people can successfully
internalize.  My father bought an early Macintosh that came with AOL.
He learned enough to be able to read and send email, and to use
instant messenger.  But that was about it.  As the Web and other
services became more popular, he just couldn't make the cognitive leap
that AOL was only a subset of the Internet.  My father is far from
being alone.  Many thousands of people have never made it beyond AOL.
It's almost as if AOL is Whoville, in Dr. Suess's <i>Horton Hears a
Who</i>, but they believe that the tiny speck of dust they are living on
is a planet and that there is nothing beyond it&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that most people who have been left behind, never
understand that they are behind.  They have a fuzzy idea that their
mental model doesn't quite fit, but then they dismiss the idea
because, it works just fine for them.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who has started a tech startup that working on the bleeding
edge will be all too familiar with this problem.
</p>

<p>
When pitching ideas for new startups, everything is new and the
founders fully understand that it will take some amount of effort to
get people to understand what they are building and why it's a good
idea.  But time and time again, it seems that most potential investors
simply are too far behind the technological curve for them to even
grasp technoligies that are in common use, let alone new technolgies
that will replace those.
</p>

<p>
Quite recently, I was thrown into a pitch without being told that I
was giving a pitch until it was already happening.  I explained that
we are building a distributed cloud service for SE Asia that will
adapt wildly successful cloud services worth hundreds of millions of
dollars for developing markets in the region.  But for some reason,
they couldn't get their head around the concept of a Cloud service,
because they couldn't make the distinction between an Telco and an
ISP.  We were conceptually lumped in with a Telco that he knew in
Phnom Penh which had spent millions of dollars and failed.  He had a
rough concept of a Telco, which used networks and computers to provide
communication services.  And since many Telcos offer Internet
connectivity, Internet services were just part of a Telco.  So the
idea of a Cloud Service was several generations of technology behind,
it was impossible for him to grasp the concept, and we were dismissed
out of hand.
</p>

<p>
In other cases, you might be able to explain a new technology in
relation to a metaphor that they do understand.  So you might make a
pitch around the Search metaphor.  Well, this company is a little like
Google Search in that is does A, B and C.  But it is <i>not</i> search
because it does D, E, F.  But you lost them as soon as you said it's
like Google because in their mind you're building a search engine.
</p>

<p>
This is always compounded by potential investors who sort of
understand what you are pitching, but then go to a trusted friend who
is a self proclaimed expert who has no idea what they are talking
about.  The result is inevitably the same.  "Sorry, we can't become
involved", they say, "it's already been done."  The fact that when
Google and Facebook had started, both search and social sites had
certainly "already been done" was irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
When &#x2026;&#x2026; was pitching Hotmail around Silicon Valley, he was nearly
laughed out of town.  People couldn't grasp the concept of <i>webmail</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is very much a <i>failure of imagination</i>, an inability not only to
understand what something is, but also a failure to see the potential
of something that they do understand in the future.
</p>

<p>
Even people who have been at the cutting edge of technological
development get it wrong sometimes.  Bill Gates refused to integrate
Microsoft products with the Internet until it was almost too late.
And Steve Ballmer waited so long to develop a proper mobile platform
that is probably is too late.
</p>

<p>
I have a pretty good track record in recognizing technoligies that
will become big in the future.  But I've gotten it wrong too.  When we
were running our Hong Kong ISP, Huge Net in the mid-90's we had one
customer who gave away free Web Page hosting.  He kept adding new
customers, added servers and kept upgrading his bandwidth to handle
the traffic.  And yet he had no revenue stream.  He gave it all away
for free, and was loosing a lot of money every month in the process.
</p>

<p>
This went on for nearly three years, when suddenly he told us that he
had sold his company for $20 million.  We didn't have deep enough
pockets to have done this ourselves, but we'd completely missed the
emerging business model at the time to build up value in a company by
building up a large user base and then selling the company without
ever trying to generate revenue from the customer base.
</p>

<p>
Is there any way of reaching these people who are trapped in
hopelessly out of data metaphorical loops?  In most cases, the answer
is likely no.  Because the reason the future is distributed, is not
only not evenly distributed, it can never be evenly distributed as
each of us hits that wall and are left behind to spend the rest of our
lives trapped in techological conceptual tital pools.
</p>

<p>
Over very long periods of time, this context is all but lost, and the
meaning of things will drastically change.  Homer's Odyssey and Illiad
were not written, they were stories that evolved as part of the Oral
Tradition before writing systems had been invented in the Greek
States.  They were not so much an art form, as a means of preserving
the complexities of Greek culture and passing them on from one
generation to another.  The Muses were not inspirational, they
represented the collection of tools that the poet used to memorize and
perform these works and to pass them on to future generations
unchanged.  They acted as a kind of encyclopedia for a culture and
complex society.
</p>

<p>
But that original context surrounding Homer's works was nearly
forgotten as man moved from an Oral Tradition to a Written Tradition.
In the Written Traditional, narrative prose is a far better means of
recording and passing on information to other people today and to
future generations.  So poetry and Homer's encyclopedia gradually
became known only as a story, as entertainment and studied in a
context where poetry is a creative work of art.
</p>





<p>
if you can see the relationship of
something you don't know, to something you do understand
</p>




<p>
Whether we realize it or not, people who had internalized a number of
different early stages of the info-network revolution have now hit
their ability to significantly change their mental models and are
being left behind.
