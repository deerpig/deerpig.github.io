<h2 id="sec-1">The Studyhall Template</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The Studyhall is a template for a new kind of educational and research
institution for the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
The Studyhall helps students to master the skills and knowledge needed
to manage and develop the cutting edge technologies that are changing
the world. Studyhalls do not have traditional classrooms, or even a
standard curriculum.  Students learn by working together with masters
in residence at the Studyhall's SkunkWorks doing original open source
research and development.
</p>

<p>
Graduates from the program will then go out into their communities to
teach other people in universities and government, as well as start
their own companies.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Components</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Each Studyhall is made up of six core components:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Tutorial &amp; Apprentice Program</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The program is broken into two parts.  The first is a three month
walk-in <code>Tutorial Program</code> modeled on <i>hackerschool.com</i>, that will
provide students with a crash course in the basic skills needed to
learn programing and linux based systems as well as the communication
skills needed for student to participate in the global online
development communities that provide support for beginners and masters
alike.  The second part will be a six month <code>Apprentice Program</code> where
students will be paired with masters who will mentor them and work
with them on projects in the Skunkworks.  Students graduating from the
apprentice program will have a portfolio of work they can use to get
jobs, as well as being eligible to apply the <code>Incubator</code> program if
they want to start their own companies.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Sabbatical Program</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The <code>Sabbatical Program</code> is broken into three parts.  First, is a
volunteer program for high tech professionals living near to the
studyhall to volunteer to tudor and mentor students in the tutorial
program.  Second will be a Gap Year program where international
students with technical experience can live and work in the Studyhall
for anywhere from a week to several months.  Gap year volunteers will
help with students in both the tutorial and apprentice students as
well as work with students and masters on projects in the skunk
works.  Finally, a sabbatical program will invite masters from
academia and the corporate to live and work at the study hall for 2
weeks to three months.  Masters will be on paid leave from their jobs,
to collaborate on projects in the Skunk Works.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Skunkworks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
A Skunk Works is typically a division or department set up in a
company that is allowed to work on advanced research or development
independently from the corporate hierarchy.  Skunk works are known for
developing innovative and cutting edge products that would have been
difficult or impossible through normal channels in a company or
government.  A <i>Studyhall</i> <code>Skunk Works</code> will take on important problems
that either is not being addressed, or can't be done within
traditional research or commercial.  The hardware designs and software
that the Skunk Works develops will be released to the public domain
under an open source licence so it can be freely used by individuals,
government, industry and universities.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Compute/Storage Computer Cluster</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
At the heart of every Studyhall will be a computer cluster (a group of
computers that act as a single very powerful computer).  The cluster
will run the <i>OpenStack</i> Cloud computing application.  This will provide
everyone within the studyhall (students and masters alike) with a very
powerful tool for doing advanced research and development.  The
cluster will include everything needed for doing large computational
processing jobs as well as massive amounts of archival storage.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Fab &amp; Scan Labs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
The <code>Fab Lab</code> (named after its very well funded counterpart at MIT) is
a hardware laboratory that has computer controlled tool for
fabricating physical objects as well as develop electronics.  The Lab
will include <i>3D Printers</i>, <i>CNC Milling</i> machines, <i>laser cutters</i> and
other more traditional tools.  Students will learn to design 3D models
that can then be printed or milled into real objects.  The Lab will
also have <i>Arduino</i> boards and <i>Raspberry Pi's</i> that students can use to
build everything from robots to home electronic products.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Scan Lab</code> is a facility to convert any kind of information or
media on analog media (paper, film, tape, disk etc) into native
digital formats.  The Lab will include <code>book scanners</code>, <code>video
capture</code> converters, <code>flatbed scanners</code>, video and audio editing
workstations as well as <code>OCR</code> (optical character readers),
proofreading, cataloging software systems.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-6">Incubator</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
The incubator program will be a early stage startup incubator similar
to <i>Y-Combinator</i>.  Students who have graduted from the apprenticeship
program have the option of forming a team and apply for angel
investment to start their own company.  Successful applicants will
recieve enough money to found a company, and develop a demonstration
of a product or service.  When the demo is ready, the incubator will
arange a demo day for the startup to show their demo to Venture
Capitalists to raise a large first round of investment funding for
their venture.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-7">Store</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7">
<p>
The Studyhall Store (as well as the tutorial center) was inspired by
826 Valencia's Pirate Supply store:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Named after our street location in the Mission District of San
Francisco, 826 Valencia was founded in 2002 by educator NÃ­nive
Calegari and author Dave Eggers, who were looking for a way to support
overburdened teachers and connect talented working adults with the
students who could use their help the most.
</p>

<p>
Because our space was zoned for retail, we needed to open a
store. After briefly considering a hot dog stand, we looked at the
ship-like surfaces of the stripped-down space, a former gym, and
decided to open a pirate store instead.
</p>

<p>
Behind the store we built a writing lab, designed to be a place kids
would want to spend time, with a cozy reading tent, big work tables,
and lots of books. Word spread quickly, and soon every chair was
filled with students working on their writing with our trained
tutors. We currently serve over 6,000 students a year thanks to our
corps of over 1,700 volunteers. Inspired by the success of 826
Valencia, seven more 826 chapters have opened in cities across the
country; New York, Chicago, Ann Arbor, Seattle, Los Angeles, Boston,
and Washington, D.C. are all home to a unique branch of 826.
</p>

<p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://826valencia.org/store">The Pirate Store</a>, "San Francisco's Only Inpedent Pirate Supply Store",
"provides everything for the working buccaneer".  The shop sells
wooden peg legs, eye patches, belly of the whale escape kits and a
variety of pirate related goods.
</p>

<p>
All of the Valencia 826 tutorial centers have their own distinct stores.
One shop in Los Angeles is a <i>Mini Mart for Time Travelers</i>, in New
York there is a <i>Superhero Supply Shop</i>, and in New Hampshire there is a
<i>Big Foot Research Institute</i>.
</p>

<p>
Studyhall Stores will work the same way, as a fun and whimsical
interface between the other parts of the Studyhall and the public.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Progress: Phnom Penh Pilot Project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first pilot Studyhall is set to open in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in
the second half of 2013.  The project is in the process of being
established as a Cambodian NGO and already has a small team in place.
</p>

<p>
A detailed project proposal and budget is in the final stages of being
prepared and sponsors are being approached to obtain a building,
purchase equipment and pay for staff.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Phnom Penh Studyhall Store</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The Phnom Penh Studyhall Shop will be called <i>The Naga General Supply
Company</i>.  Naga are mythical river dragons which are thought to live
in the big rivers in South East Asia like the Mekong, Tonle or
Irrawaddy.  Naga General Supply will provide provisioning for Naga
researchers who are mounting expeditions to study the Naga.  The store
will sell Naga food, field guides for identifying different species of
Naga in the field, and even heart burn medicine for Naga (Naga tend to
get heartburn after belching fireballs).  The store will organize many
activities, including river cruises along the Mekong to go "Naga
watching".  These events will help people learn about the Studyhall
and tutorial center, as well as provide a fun way to do fundraising.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Future Plans</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The Phnom Penh Studyhall will provide a template that can be used to
establish other Studyhalls around the world.  There will be a special
emphasis on establishing the first Studyhalls in developing countries
in South East Asia.  A proposal to use the Studyhall concept as a
foundation for establishing a Research Network along the Mekong River
Basin is being prepared and is expected to be submited to ASEAN in the
coming months.  But, it should be remembered that Studyhalls could be
built and thrive almost anywhere on the planet, not just East Asia.
