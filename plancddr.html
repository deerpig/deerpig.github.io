<p>
The inspiration for the <i>Big Vision</i> for what became Chenla happened
in 1997, when I was living in Osaka. I was sitting at my desk on the
third floor office where I worked.  The room was damp and mildewy and
infused with the smell of the thousands of cigarettes that the girls
in the office chain smoked throughout the day, when I came across an
article on the Web about the <a href="http://longnow.org/clock/">10,000 Year clock</a>.  The clock was to be a
mechanical computer, two floors tall, that would be housed in a cave,
and run with little or no human intervention for 10,000 years.<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But what struck me back in '97 was the brief mention that a library
was planned to go along with the clock.  I was hooked, and I knew that
I wanted to build that library.
</p>

<p>
As I began working through the challenges of building such a library,
It quickly became apparent that the library with the clock would be
little more than a time-capsule intended for the distant future.  And
while that was an interesting problem in itself, the real challenge
would to create a living library that would grow over time and could
survive 10,000 years, and the collapse of civilization, not once, but
many times.
</p>

<p>
To do that, the library would have to be distributed, with many copies
scattered around the planet, or even on the moon or Mars if people
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> are able to fulfill their goal of making mankind a
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/ELON-MUSK-We-Need-To-Leave-Earth-Or-Risk-4559784.php">multi-planet species</a>.
</p>

<p>
Collapse is inevitable.  Over millions of years, earth's climate
oscillates between a carbon rich green house and a oxygen rich cold
house dominated by an ice age.  The collapse of ecosystems, followed
by mass extinctions are a regular cycle in the earth's long history.
</p>

<p>
Human civilizations have followed a similar pattern of growth and
collapse in the brief 10,000 years since mankind first developed
civilization.  Some 40 civilizations, depending on your definition of
civilization, have risen and fallen already.  The next collapse is not
a matter of if, but when, and then how total the collapse will be, and
the subsequent rebuilding that comes afterwards.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This is especially relevant today because, for the first time in human
history, we now effectively have a single global interdependent
civilization.  The economic shock wave from the earthquake that rocked
Taiwan in September 1999 was felt around the world for years.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A significant proportion of the world supply of RAM was at the time
made in Taiwan, and the six-day shutdown of Hsinchu Science Park and
other factories resulting from the quake caused computer memory prices

More recently, the 2011 Bangkok floods had a global impact:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The economies of other countries besides Thailand will be
significantly impacted by the flood. The country that will be hardest
hit is Japan. Japanese firms with plants in Thailand include Toyota,
Honda, Hitachi, and Canon. One analyst predicted the profits of one
firm, Toyota, may be cut by ¥200 billion (US$2.5 billion). Worker
incomes in Thailand and Japan are also impacted.

The economic impact of the Bangkok floods on Japan ended up being
greater than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tōhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a> in 2011.  The Bangkok
floods, significantly impacted the world economy as a whole.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Thailand's flood helped contribute to a total estimated US$259 billion
in economic losses for the first nine months of 2011. These losses
represented 80% of the world's total economic losses and the insurance
industry has responded by raising rates in some areas between 50 and
200 percent or by outright not accepting new clients in Asia.

<p>
The global impact of these natural disasters stems from the way the
global civilization is structured.  Our civilization is not evenly
distributed.  There are many examples of places in the world that have
a virtual a monopoly on the knowledge and means of production in
producing a narrow set of things that are vital to the global
civilization and economy.
</p>

<p>
If you knock one of these areas out, the entire world will be effected
for years, but things <i>will</i> recover.  The real danger is if several
of these places are knocked out by any combination of natural
disaster, war, or disease at the same time.  The impact of such a
scenario could well be enough to trigger a decline and eventual
collapse of global civilization that can not be recovered from.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">Khmer Rouge, Cambodia</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
I live in Cambodia and collapse here is no abstract concept.  Cambodia
is even now still in the process of a complete restore of their
culture and civilization after the <i>Khmer Rouge</i> killed over 2 million
people.
</p>

<p>
Pol Pot was what Charles Stross called in his novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scratch-Monkey-Charles-Stross/dp/1886778957/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1371622326&sr=8-2&keywords=scratch+monkey+charles+stross">Scratch Monkey</a>, a
<i>Year Zero Man</i>, who believed the only way to realize a communist
utopia was to basically kill everyone from the old society and start
over again from year zero.  The <i>Khmer Rouge</i> didn't only target
people, but history, culture, music, and education as well.  More was
lost than will ever be known.
</p>

<p>
When I was living here twelve years ago, there was almost no
infrastructure, the roads in the capital city Phnom Penh were little
more than ruts.  You could still hear gun fire at night, and many
buildings like the Red Cross building were little more than burnt out
shells.  People were still in sort of a state of shock, and were
guarded.  Flash forward till today and you would never recognize the
city.  A new 38 floor sky scrapper which is nearly finished can be
seen from my balcony, and poking through the trees the pinnacle of the
beautifully restored 13th century pagodga, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phnom">Wat Phnom</a> can be seen.
Across a broad green belt the future Securities and Exchange Building
which will house the new Cambodia Stock Market is slowly emerging from
the ruins of an older government building.  But there are still many
gaps that haven't been filled.  Even restoring Cambodian music and
cuisine is an ongoing work in progress.  And they're having to make it
all up as they go along.  It's a long painful process that is made far
more difficult because so much of what was destroyed was lost forever.

MAKE SOME GODDAMN COPIES PEOPLE. CIVILISATION DOESN'T BACKUP ITSELF.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Danny O'B ‏<a href="http://twitter.com/mala">@mala</a> \\Twitter 2013-01-15
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Going back to the original concept of a 10,000 year library, the
question becomes what would it be for?
</p>

<p>
For a library that is designed to be used for thousands of years,
it's purpose must also address the most critical problems that mankind
will face over the next 10,000 years.  And clearly, that problem will
be the cyclical collapse of complex human societies and the survival of
the human species over time spans of hundreds of thousands of years or
more into the future.
</p>

<p>
As we have already discussed, collapse is not evenly distributed.
Smaller collapses are more common than total collapse.  And it is
hoped that in improving the way that we deal with local collapse, and
ensure that what is critical to societies and cultures are preserved,
so that they can be restored, that we can forestall, the instances of
total collapse whenever possible.  And even when there is a total
collapse, that enough is preserved and remembered to shorten the time
it will take to restore civilization and mitigate some of the long
term consequences that would otherwise sink humanity into another Dark
Age that could last centuries.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When civilizations truly crash, no one at the time can imagine the
depth of the fall, nor how labored and long the revival, if it ever
happens. After Rome fell, “Europe went unwashed for a thousand years.”
Cities emptied; literacy vanished. All the Roman achievements of
engineering, culture, and government simply ceased to be. Population
in some areas dropped by nine-tenths. Even with the heroic continuity
of the Catholic Church, the skein of culture was reduced to fragile
wisps: Only one copy of Lucretius made it through the Dark Ages, only
one copy of five books of Livy, one copy of nine plays of Euripides,
one copy of Tacitus, one copy of Beowulf.

<p>
So how do we go about building a library that can help buffer the
impact of different collapses over thousands of years?  Computers face
their own version of collapse on a regular basis.  Equipment failure,
data corruption, accidental erasure and malicious destruction are all
too common with computer systems.  To mitigate such disasters, you
make a <code>backup</code> of the system, which is a snapshot of a running system
at the time the backup was made.
</p>

<p>
In the event of a system failure, restoring the system is as simple as
wiping the memory of the system and copying the backup and then
restarting the system.  If all goes well, you will only have lost
changes since the last backup was made.
</p>

<p>
This is a good way of thinking about the library.  The library should
a <code>Backup</code> of civilization, and compiled into a <code>Primer</code> that can be
used to <code>Restore</code> civilization in a structured and systematic manner.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Primer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
The idea of a Primer to restore civilization is not new, though I
haven't researched this yet.  I was first introduced to the idea as a
teenager in the novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0671741926">The Mote in God's Eye</a> by Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle, where an alien race maintains a museum and library of
weapons technology that is needed when the aliens periodically wipe
each other out.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps a little closer to what we are looking for was proposed by
the biologist James Lovelock.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
James Lovelock&#x2026;. proposed compiling a start-up manual for
civilization, beginning with how to make fire, moving on through all
of science and technology, from subjects such as ancient genetic
design (domesticating plants and animals by selective breeding) to
current genetic design (cloning).

<p>
To call it a primer is a a bit of a misnomer, in that the primer would
dwarf even the very largest of today's libraries.  But it <i>would</i> be a
primer in that it would first provide an introduction to any number of
concepts and topics to an unknown audience, sometime in the future,
who may have even lost written writing.  No assumptions can be made
except that optimistic assumption there will be an audience left alive
to read the primer.
</p>

<p>
The primer would contain three core categories of information.  The
first is <code>descriptive</code> information, which includes the vast majority
of cultural, scientific and academic recorded works, including books,
periodicals, audio recordings, images, video etc..  The second is
<code>proscriptive</code> information, which includes recipes, instructions,
methods, methods and manuals for building and doing things.  Finally,
there would be <code>data</code> which includes any type of unstructured recorded
tabular or imaging data.  This would include anything from population
records, to weather data, to satellite telemetry and imaging.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6">Backup</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
The Backup is, more than anything else a process, community and a kind
of hybrid institution.  It's core mission is in two parts.  First the
Backup will be responsible for gathering the materials that will
become part of the primer, organize and keep them up to date and safe.
Second, the backup will ensure that organizations who do provide
libraries which are open to the public are able to maintain complete
collections so that works aren't lost to general circulation.  In
other words they will will provide public libraries with a source of
last resort for any work in the Arc's collection.
</p>

<p>
At the heart of the backup will be a distributed network of dark
archives.  We call them dark because they will not be connected
directly to the Internet, though the people maintaining the Backup
will be.  The <code>Dark Arcs</code> as we're calling them, will not be
accessible by the general public either.  
</p>

<p>
In fact, the less people know about them the better.  Mankind has a
long history of devolving into long bouts of temporary insanity.
Censorship and book burning and general destruction of recorded
information is an age old pass time, which will not change in the
future.  
</p>

<p>
Keeping mankind's collective memories and experience safe will require
that there are many copies in as many locations as possible, and
ensure that during periods of temporary insanity, as we are seeing
today in fundamentalist religious groups from all religions, as well
by authoritarian governments who want to rewrite history for their own
purposes.
</p>

<p>
For the backup to succeed, it will have to be designed so that no
matter how much damage people do, that some copies will survive the
purges to be restored when sanity has been restored.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">Restore</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
Rebuilding from a complete systemic collapse is not as simple as
handing people an iPad with a copy of the primer.  As Charles Stross
wrote, "it takes an industrial civilization, to build an industrial
civilization."  A complete restore will take generations, even if
everything goes well, and with access to comprehensive primer.  The
alternative is to reinvent everything from scratch, not knowing the
pitfalls or the optimal way to accomplish what needs to be done.  This
could well take centuries or even millennia.
</p>

<p>
Like the Backup, the Restore is a process that can be adapted to meet
the needs of what needs to be restored and within the constraints of
what is available.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Restore</code> would, as Locklock said, start with the basics of
survival, meeting the base levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslows Hierarchy of Needs</a>, food,
shelter, and physical safety, and then progress up the ladder, by
adding increasing complexity, structure and technology layer by layer.
</p>

<p>
Over long periods of thousands of years, the backup process, and
primer will thoroughly field tested and used to restore different
parts of civilization, and perhaps even the entire global civilization
if things get bad enough.  After each restore the experience of
backing up and restoring will be refined, to limit the scope of
whatever had caused the collapse, mitigate its worst effects and
dramatically shorten the time needed to reestablish civilization.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-8">The Vision Vs. Implementation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
There is no question that the vision outlined here is not a trivial
endeavour to even contemplate, let alone to execute.  But it's also
true that it is valuable, indeed, even crucial to the future survival
of our civilization and perhaps even our species.
</p>

<p>
So, I hear you saying, how to get started?  
</p>

<p>
We have been working for nearly a decade on develop data structures
and markup languages and a framework that is designed for preserving
context as well as the individual items in the collection over very
long time frames which we call the <code>Burr Metadata Framework</code> (BMF).
</p>

<p>
BMF will be used as the foundation for our long-term archive and
library software framework which is called <code>Saltmine</code> that will power
the archives and Studyhalls.
</p>

<p>
Second, we have been developing the <a href="./Studyhall.html">Studyhall Template</a> as a
fundamental institutional building block for the project, which can be
used for education, research, development, the establishment of
archives, and connections to existing public-facing libraries.  Since
Studyhalls are federated and distributed, and designed to be setup
anywhere, relatively inexpensively.  Our hope is that the Template
will be eventually adopted around the world.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we are in the process of turning this essay into a full blown
detailed proposal.  The proposal will be in the form of a book(s) that
will set out our initial vision for the Studyhalls, Primer, Backup and
Restore.  We are calling this, <code>Plan Cddr</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Plan Cddr will complement other large scale global initiatives like
Rocky Mountain Institute's Reinventing Fire, and <a href="http://www.earth-policy.org/books/pb4">Plan B</a> from the
Lester Brown's <a href="http://earth-policy.org">Earth Policy Institute</a> which are taking on the daunting
task of mobilizing people, companies and governments to tackle the
challenge of addressing the combined challenges of climate change,
population growth, water resource allocation and manage, food and
energy production.  We aim to the the library and knowledge base for
all of these initiatives and countless others.  But will also lay the
groundwork for surviving and rebuilding in the event that they fail.
</p>

<p>
We are in the early stages of establishing the first Studyhall in
Phnom Penh Cambodia and complete work on the first release of
<code>Saltmine</code>.  A second Studyhall will be established Vientiane, Laos
PDR in late 2014.
