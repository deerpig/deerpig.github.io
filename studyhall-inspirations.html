<h2 id="sec-1">Inspiration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The Studyhall Project has been inspired by a number of different
concepts and projects which share a belief in creating local
community-based spaces for students have access to one on one tutoring
and computing.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Chinese Studyhalls</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
A common feature found in old prosperous Chinese walled villages
throughout China is a building which is often next to or attatched to
the Ancestral Hall which is known simply as the Studyhall.  Studyhalls
are often adorned with brightly painted sculptures depicting
auspicious symbols like peaches which are meant to help students
succeed in their studies.
</p>

<p>
Studyhalls have been used for a variety of purposes at different times
in history, from being a place for students to study and be privately
tutored, to the Chinese equivilent of the venerable American
one-room-schoolhouse.
</p>

<p>
In a culture where families are traditionally packed together into
very tight living spaces, the studyhall is a place apart from the
noise and chaos of family life where students can find the peace and
quiet needed to concentrate on their studies.
</p>

<p>
The studyhall is also an intensely local space which is an extension
of home, which reinforces that the success of student is important to
the success of your family and clan.
</p>

<p>
In poverty stricken communities all along the Mekong, these are
virtues and themes worth emulating and reinforcing.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">826 National</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Another important influence on the studyhall project is 826 National.
According to Wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
826 National is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping
students, ages 6–18, with expository and creative writing at eight
locations across USA. The chapters include 826 Valencia in San
Francisco, 826NYC in Brooklyn, New York, 826LA in Los Angeles, CA,
826CHI in Chicago, 826 Seattle, 826michigan in Ann Arbor, 826 Boston
in Boston, and 826DC in Washington, DC (formerly the Capitol Letters
Writing Collective). The 826 National mission is based on the
understanding that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one
attention, and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future
success. Each 826 chapter provides drop-in tutoring, class field
trips, writing workshops, and in-schools programs—all free of
charge. 826 chapters are especially committed to supporting teachers,
publishing student work, and offering services for English language
learners.

<ul class="org-ul"><li>826 National Stores<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<p>
An important part of the <i>826 National</i> recipe are the
retail storefronts that most of their centers have:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To raise funds, inspire creativity, and advertise our programs to the
local community, most of our centers include a street-front retail
store filled with unusual products, entertaining signage, and, of
course, our books for sale. San Francisco’s pirate supply store sells
glass eyes and one-of-a-kind peglegs, 826 NYC’s Superhero Supply
Company offers custom-fit capes, Seattle’s Greenwood Space Travel
Supply Company sells all your space commuting appurtenances, 826
michigan's Liberty Street Robot Supply &amp; Repair Shop specializes in
must-have mechanical conveniences, while 826LA features a time travel
store, there's a secret agent supply store in Chicago, and the
Cryptozoology shop in Boston is now open!
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<li>Champasak Studyhall Store<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
We are still unsure if the retail storefront will make the
cultural transition from the United States to the Mekong
river basin, but we've come up with some interesting concept
for a possible store along the same lines as 826 National.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Phaya Naga</i> is a mythical river creature which is
believed to inhabit the Mekong River.  It is a bit like Loch
Ness' Nessie in Scotland, or Lake Champlain's <i>Champie</i> in
Vermont except the Naga are a species rather than a specific
individual.
</p>

<p>
On the last day of Buddhist Lent, thousands of people gather
on the banks of the Mekong in Nonkai, Thailand to watch for
the Naga to shoot fireballs into the sky.  Nongkai hosts a
water parade and festival to welcome the Naga each year.
</p>

<p>
In 2003, an investigative television reporter brought a
camera into the bushes on the Lao side of the river and
captured footage of Lao soldiers shooting tracer rounds into
the sky.
</p>

<p>
The incident sparked a huge kerfuffle in Nonkai.  Spirited
town hall meetings were hastily organized by the Nonkai city
government who were scared of loosing an important tourist
attraction.  Scientists were produced who claimed the
fireballs were caused by vegetation which fermented on the
bottom of the river which created gas clouds.
</p>

<p>
So we thought it fitting that the storefront would be a
Phaya Naga Supply Store.  Possible products could include
Naga food (which can also be used to feed Koi and other
fish), Naga Eggs (small watermellons which are sold in a
branded box in a small straw nest, Naga heartburn medicine
(those fireballs are caused from indigestion) and even a
field guide to spotting and identifying different types of
Naga in the wild.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">One Laptop Per Child</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
According to Wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The One Laptop Per Child Association (OLPC) is a U.S.  non-profit
organization set up to oversee the creation of an affordable
educational device for use in the developing world. Its mission is "to
create educational opportunities for the world's poorest children by
providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected
laptop with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful,
self-empowered learning."  Negroponte states that the mission is to
eliminate poverty. Its current focus is on the development,
construction and deployment of the XO-1 laptop&#x2026;.  As of October
2009, there are 1.6 million free books available for OLPC computers.
