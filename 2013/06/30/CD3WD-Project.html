    <h3>The CD3WD Project</h3>
    <h4>Posted  on <a href="/2013/06/30/CD3WD-Project.html" title="Permalink for this

  <div class="item_content">
    
<p>
I'm nearly finished reading Annalee Newitz's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scatter-Adapt-Remember-Survive-Extinction/dp/0385535910/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372597825&sr=8-1&keywords=scatter,+adapt,+remember">Scatter, Adapt, and
Remember</a>.  I will have more to say about her book when I'm finished,
but I wanted to mention a the <a href="http://cd3wd.com/">CD3WD</a> project which she wrote about in
the book.  Newitz described CD3WD as something that could potentially
be used as a primer to rebuild civilization after a collapse.
</p>

<p>
CD3WD stated mission is a little more down to earth.  Their website
says that CD3WD's purpose is to create "a free but high quality
collection of practical How-To Technical Development Information -
helping the 3rd world to help itself."  But Newitz is correct, in many
respects CD3WD could be used as a source for rebuilding after a
collapse.  The person behind CD3WD is Alex Weir, an expat
Microsoft-stack software programmer, based in Botswana.  He has
obviously been trying to sell the project to the NGO community:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The International Community and International and local NGO's for some
strange reason have zero or even negative interest in cd3wd - maybe
they can see the writing on the wall - a dynamic and self-sufficient
3rd world which has democratically and peacefully shaken off its
pro-Western and its anti-Western charlatan dictator-presidents will
have little or no need for NGO's. This lack of interest and hostility
is however regrettable, since their involvement could hasten their own
departure.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think a case could also be made for encouraging the adoption and use
of OSS (Open Source Software) in developing countries, where vendor
lock-in is used as a means of keeping whole countries dependent on
multi-national corporations like Microsoft and Oracle.
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, Weir has put together an invaluable collection of
material and is making it available for free via the Web, Bit
Torrent, as well as on DVD and other physical media.
</p>

<p>
The danger is, that if he can't get NGO's and governments interested,
the project could be lumped in with the people who <i>are</i> most
interested in the collection at the moment; doomsday preppers,
survivalists and the <i>every man for himself</i> crowd.  That would be be
a shame because the everything they stand is a <i>complete
opposite</i> of what Weir is trying to achieve.  Weir wants to build a
better world, not give up hide in a bunker while everything falls
apart around them.
</p>

<p>
I believe that part of the disinterest on the part of many NGO's is
that many people working for NGO's are from developed countries.  They
are middle-class latte slurpers, with iPhones and 3G access to the
Internet.  It's difficult to get them to understand <i>why</i> such a
collection was needed, because you can swipe your finger across your
phone any time and <i>just Google it</i>.
</p>

<p>
The second problem, from my perspective, is that the collection is
pretty much just a JBOF (just a bunch of files).  There is little
structure to the collection, and <i>no context</i>.  A very large number
of the documents only make sense in the context for the audience they
were intended for.  There are all sorts of files that describe
methods for doing things like building with bamboo, but they are
worthless in SE Asia because they are written so that people from
Western countries can understand Asian building techniques.  They are
a terrible way of documenting those techniques for people who live
there.
</p>

<p>
And that contexual mismatch will only grow over time.  Weir has
undertaken a task of heroic proportions, but it is only a first step.
<a href="./plancddr.html">Plan CDDR</a> is designed to take collections like this, and capture the
context that is needed to make the collection useful irrespective of
where it is used, and to remain useful for a very long time into the
future.
