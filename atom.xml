&lt;p&gt;
Just uploaded the &lt;a href=&quot;./slides/studyhall.html&quot;&gt;Studyhall Slide Deck&lt;/a&gt; on our &lt;a href=&quot;./slides.html&quot;&gt;Presentations&lt;/a&gt; page.
This will be the primary presentation that we will be using when
pitching the Studyhall.  This took a suprisingly large amount of work
to put together.  I hope the effort was worth it.  We expect the
Presentation will evolve over time, as we fine tune our pitch over
time, so expect it to change from time to time.  As always, feedback
is welcome.

   <title>The CD3WD Project</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2013/06/30/CD3WD-Project.html"/>
   <updated>2013-06-30T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/06/30/CD3WD-Project</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
I'm nearly finished reading Annalee Newitz's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Scatter-Adapt-Remember-Survive-Extinction/dp/0385535910/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372597825&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=scatter,+adapt,+remember&quot;&gt;Scatter, Adapt, and
Remember&lt;/a&gt;.  I will have more to say about her book when I'm finished,
but I wanted to mention a the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cd3wd.com/&quot;&gt;CD3WD&lt;/a&gt; project which she wrote about in
the book.  Newitz described CD3WD as something that could potentially
be used as a primer to rebuild civilization after a collapse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
CD3WD stated mission is a little more down to earth.  Their website
says that CD3WD's purpose is to create &quot;a free but high quality
collection of practical How-To Technical Development Information -
helping the 3rd world to help itself.&quot;  But Newitz is correct, in many
respects CD3WD could be used as a source for rebuilding after a
collapse.  The person behind CD3WD is Alex Weir, an expat
Microsoft-stack software programmer, based in Botswana.  He has
obviously been trying to sell the project to the NGO community:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The International Community and International and local NGO's for some
strange reason have zero or even negative interest in cd3wd - maybe
they can see the writing on the wall - a dynamic and self-sufficient
3rd world which has democratically and peacefully shaken off its
pro-Western and its anti-Western charlatan dictator-presidents will
have little or no need for NGO's. This lack of interest and hostility
is however regrettable, since their involvement could hasten their own
departure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think a case could also be made for encouraging the adoption and use
of OSS (Open Source Software) in developing countries, where vendor
lock-in is used as a means of keeping whole countries dependent on
multi-national corporations like Microsoft and Oracle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Aside from that, Weir has put together an invaluable collection of
material and is making it available for free via the Web, Bit
Torrent, as well as on DVD and other physical media.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The danger is, that if he can't get NGO's and governments interested,
the project could be lumped in with the people who &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; most
interested in the collection at the moment; doomsday preppers,
survivalists and the &lt;i&gt;every man for himself&lt;/i&gt; crowd.  That would be be
a shame because the everything they stand is a &lt;i&gt;complete
opposite&lt;/i&gt; of what Weir is trying to achieve.  Weir wants to build a
better world, not give up hide in a bunker while everything falls
apart around them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I believe that part of the disinterest on the part of many NGO's is
that many people working for NGO's are from developed countries.  They
are middle-class latte slurpers, with iPhones and 3G access to the
Internet.  It's difficult to get them to understand &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; such a
collection was needed, because you can swipe your finger across your
phone any time and &lt;i&gt;just Google it&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second problem, from my perspective, is that the collection is
pretty much just a JBOF (just a bunch of files).  There is little
structure to the collection, and &lt;i&gt;no context&lt;/i&gt;.  A very large number
of the documents only make sense in the context for the audience they
were intended for.  There are all sorts of files that describe
methods for doing things like building with bamboo, but they are
worthless in SE Asia because they are written so that people from
Western countries can understand Asian building techniques.  They are
a terrible way of documenting those techniques for people who live
there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And that contexual mismatch will only grow over time.  Weir has
undertaken a task of heroic proportions, but it is only a first step.
&lt;a href=&quot;./plancddr.html&quot;&gt;Plan CDDR&lt;/a&gt; is designed to take collections like this, and capture the
context that is needed to make the collection useful irrespective of
where it is used, and to remain useful for a very long time into the
future.

   <title>Making Sense of Things</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2013/06/23/Making-Sense.html"/>
   <updated>2013-06-23T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/06/23/Making-Sense</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
The days since my last post, I've been trying to make sense of where
to go next.  I'm terrible at the way most people blog.  This post is a
perfect example of what I don't like about blogs.  Lot's of pointless
little posts that provide bit-sized knee-jerk reactions to things for
the sole purpose of posting something.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That defeats the purpose of the concept of the &lt;code&gt;Long Now&lt;/code&gt; by giving in
to the &lt;code&gt;Short Here&lt;/code&gt;.  And we don't want that.  But at the same time,
in a world of exponential change, out of sight for a couple of weeks,
isn't just out of mind, it's completely forgotten.  So we need to
strike some kind of balance between the two.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So instead of doing that, I'll start posting drafts of sections that
will become part of &lt;code&gt;Plan Cddr&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;StudyHall Template&lt;/code&gt;.  I'm not
that far away from having a complete outline of Plan Cddr, which we
will start publishing on &lt;a href=&quot;http://chenla.org&quot;&gt;http://chenla.org&lt;/a&gt;, which will be where we
will put all of the standards, designs, software and content that will
make up the body of work we've been talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Once we have the outline in place, I won't have to worry so much about
jumping about, because each post can point to the context of where it
fits into the big picture in the outline.  Otherwise, I might post one
day about &lt;i&gt;cisterns in toilets&lt;/i&gt; and the next about the &lt;i&gt;future of the
nation state&lt;/i&gt; and there will be no idea of how all of it is part of a
coherent big picture.  Context is everything folks.  No context, no
meaning.

&lt;p&gt;
Just uploaded &lt;a href=&quot;./plancddr.html&quot;&gt;Plan Cddr: Backup, Primer &amp;amp; Restore&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;Plan Cddr&lt;/code&gt; is
Chenla's Big Vision, that pulls together all the work we've done going
back to 1997.  The &lt;a href=&quot;./bmf_overview.html&quot;&gt;Burr Metadata Framework&lt;/a&gt;, was developed as the data
structure for the Backup.  The &lt;code&gt;Saltmine Server&lt;/code&gt; software that we are
developing will manage very long term archives and libraries encoded
in BMF.  And &lt;a href=&quot;./studyhall.html&quot;&gt;Studyhall Template&lt;/a&gt; provides a base unit for establishing
educational programs, research and development communities to build a
global, multi-lingual, distributed federated network of very long term
archives and libraries.  
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Studyhall Template</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2013/06/14/The_Studyhall_Template.html"/>
   <updated>2013-06-14T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/06/14/The_Studyhall_Template</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
We have just updated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chenla.la/studyhall.html&quot;&gt;Studyhall Template Project Page&lt;/a&gt;.  We have
been putting a lot of work into the studyhall template concept over
the last six months.  Our original goal was to establish the first
studyhall in Vientiane, Laos, which was only an hour's drive from
where I was living in Udon Thani, Thailand at the time.  We still
intend to eventually open a studyhall in Vientiane, but it won't be
our first.  Our plans abruptly changed when I was lured to Phnom Penh
with the enticement of a potentially lucrative unrelated project that
didn't pan out.  But in the process I found that I had permanently
relocated to Cambodia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So our first studyhall will be built in Phnom Penh, near the Tonle &amp;amp;
Mekong rivers. We have been approaching government ministries, local
NGO's (and there are a &lt;b&gt;lot&lt;/b&gt; of NGO's in Cambodia) and local
universities to get their reaction and feedback to the idea.  The
response has been extremely positive.  So we are now putting together
a formal business plan and detailed budget and will be establishing
ourselves as what I call an un-NGO.

   <title>FOSS Media Software Presentation</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2013/06/13/New-Presentation.html"/>
   <updated>2013-06-13T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2013/06/13/New-Presentation</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
Just uploaded a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chenla.la/slides/oss-media.html&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; that I have been giving at several
universities in Phnom Penh over the past few months.  The next
presentation will be at the &lt;i&gt;National University of Management&lt;/i&gt; in
Phnom Penh on friday 14 June.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is almost no awareness in SE Asia of any FOSS software.  In fact
if it's not from Microsoft it is largely invisable out here.  We hope
to change that.  The results have been gratifying.  When I start
showing students great media tools like Blender, Gimp, Inkscape and
Audacity they are blown away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've now dumped Powerpoint and Keynote to use HTML S5, which is a
clean HTML &amp;amp; CSS presentation format.  The presentation was made using
Emacs Org-Mode and then exported to S5.  See the notes on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://chenla.la/slides.html&quot;&gt;presentation page&lt;/a&gt; about how to navigate the presentation.

&lt;p&gt;
It's been a loooong time since we've updated the site.  We're trying
to change that now.  A lot has happened in the last couple of years.
We have now permanently moved to Wat Phnom in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
And we have a nice little office with a nice view of the park on
Street 108, from the balcony you can see the 14th century pagoda &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phnom&quot;&gt;Wat
Phnom&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a clear view of Phnom Penh's tallest building the 38
floor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbre.com.kh/2011/02/vattanac-capital/&quot;&gt;Vattanac&lt;/a&gt; which is nearing completion.  We are about three blocks
from the Tonle River, and a 15 minute walk from where the the Tonle
meets up with the mightly Mekong River.  A lot has happened, and we
have a lot of new stuff to share here in the coming weeks.

   <title>Ohfunato, Iwate Prefecture Japan Rebuilding Monument</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2011/06/15/Japan_Rebuilding_Monument.html"/>
   <updated>2011-06-15T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2011/06/15/Japan_Rebuilding_Monument</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
Our very own Chenla co-founder and artist, Ruben Seja together with
Dusan Pomothy, artist and Stanley Rodriguez, a Kumeyaay Elder, 
have been invited to construct a Rebuilding Monument to those lost in
the earthquake/tsunami earlier this year in Ohfunato, Iwate Prefecture
in Japan.  The project will be completed between 20 June and the 21
July, 2011 with the help of 20-30 volunteers from Japanese
Universities in the prefecture.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./images/ohfunato-monument.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;ohfunato-monument.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The concept is to create a monument for the Lost souls using debris
from the earthquake/tsunami area when permitted.  The momument will be
made of concrete with acid stain and a flexible opitcal silicon video
display sandwiched between glass windshields from vehicles destroyed
by the tsunami.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Survivors of the disaster will be invited to contribute memorial
photos of those lost, to be projected on the displays.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The lights, computers and displays will be powered by wind turbines
and solar panels.
&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bread Cast Upon The Waters</title>
   <link href="http://chenla.la/2010/09/26/Bread_Cast_Upon_The_Waters.html"/>
   <updated>2010-09-26T00:00:00+07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.paperplanes.de/2010/09/26/Bread_Cast_Upon_The_Waters</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
I have been thinking a great deal about how to build organizations and
institutions which can survive very long periods of time.  But how do
you justify such investments, especially to a generation the measures
time in nano-seconds and measures success by the ROI in the next
financial quarter?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In a fairly recent SALT (Seminars About Longterm Thinking) by the Long
Now Foundation entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.longnow.org/seminars/02010/feb/01/long-finance-enduring-value-conference/&quot;&gt;Long Finance&lt;/a&gt;, Stewart Brand read out an
extended quote from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Heinlein&quot;&gt;Robert Heinlein&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_for_the_Stars&quot;&gt;Time for the Stars&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the book, the &lt;b&gt;Long Range Foundation&lt;/b&gt; take on very long term goals
which require such vast amounts of both time and money that from a
near-term perspective they are pointless wastes of money.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We got interested in the purposes of the Long Range
Foundation. Its coat of arms reads: &quot;Bread Cast Upon the
Waters,&quot; and its charter is headed: &quot;Dedicated to the
Welfare of Our Descendants.&quot; The charter goes on with a lot
of lawyers' fog but the way the directors have interpreted
it has been to spend money only on things that no government
and no other corporation would touch. It wasn't enough for a
proposed project to be interesting to science or socially
desirable; it also had to be so horribly expensive that no
one else would touch it and the prospective results had to
lie so far in the future that it could not be justified to
taxpayers or shareholders. To make the LRF directors light
up with enthusiasm you had to suggest something that cost a
billion or more and probably wouldn't show results for ten
generations, if ever&amp;#x2026;something like how to control the
weather (they're working on that) or where does your lap go
when you stand up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that bread cast upon waters does come
back seven hundred fold; the most preposterous projects made
the LRF embarrassing amounts of money &amp;#x2013; &quot;embarrassing&quot; to a
non-profit corporation that is. Take space travel: it seemed
tailor-made, back a couple of hundred years ago, for LRF,
since it was fantastically expensive and offered no probable
results comparable with the investment: There was a time
when governments did some work on it for military reasons,
but the Concord of Bayreuth in 1980 put a stop even to that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So the Long Range Foundation stepped in and happily began
wasting money. It came at a time when the corporation
unfortunately had made a few billions on the Thompson
mass-converter when they had expected to spend at least a
century on pure research; since they could not declare a
dividend (no stockholders), they had to get rid of the money
somehow and space travel looked like a rat hole to pour it
down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even the kids know what happened to that: Ortega's torch
made space travel inside the solar system cheap, fast, and
easy, and the one-way energy screen made colonization
practical and profitable; the LRF could not unload fast
enough to keep from making lots more money.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;b&gt;Long Range Foundation&lt;/b&gt; projects echos a number of
themes found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report_from_Iron_Mountain&quot;&gt;Report From Iron Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/iron_mountain_full.htm&quot;&gt;full text of
the book&lt;/a&gt;); a hoax or satire (take your pick) published in
1966 by the Dial Press which claimed to be a leaked
government report from a government think tank exploring the
consequences of long term peace.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was given a copy of the book around 1978 during a lazy
summer in a century old Pennsylvania farmhouse by the wife
of a retired vice-president of Harvard University turned
gentleman farmer.  The ideas explored in the book stuck in
my head, unresolved, ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Philip Coppens wrote a excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philipcoppens.com/ironmountain.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;b&gt;The Report From
Iron Mountain&lt;/b&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lewin proposed that until substitutes for war were
developed, “war” needed to be maintained, if not improved in
effectiveness. Part of the “genius” of Lewin is in the type
of proposed potential substitutes he proposed – some of
which may have given various governments some inspiration…
or is it just coincidence that “reality” mimics fiction? The
Report’s recommendations were:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;org-ul&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a giant space-research programme whose goal was largely
impossible to achieve (a black hole, budget-wise and
hence able to feed the economy);
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new, non-human enemy, e.g. the potential
threat of an extra-terrestrial civilisation
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a new threat to Mankind, e.g. pollution
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new ways of limiting births, e.g. via adding drugs to
food or water supply
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create fictitious alternate enemies
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an omnipresent, virtually omnipotent
international police force.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many of these proposals should feel uncomfortably familiar.
When the cold war ended, new phantom enemies were erected
including the &lt;i&gt;War on Drugs&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;War on Terror&lt;/i&gt;.  These
were not real Wars.  They had no concrete objectives and no
means of ever being concluded.  But so long as they could be
used to create fear, they justified the existence of the
Nation State and the vast sums of money being thrown away to
fight them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Nation State, as we've known since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia&quot;&gt;Peace of Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;,
is on it's way out.  Finance, Transportation, Energy and
Communications are now global distributed networks which
transcend the ability of any one Nation State to control.
Pretty much all services that Nation States provide can be
delivered by either local government or the private sector.
Over the next decades all that the Nation State will have
left to offer their citizens is the threat of physical
force and the military industrial complex that Eisenhower
warned of in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eisenhower's_farewell_address&quot;&gt;farewell address&lt;/a&gt; in January 1961:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States
had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares
could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But
now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of
national defense. We have been compelled to create a
permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to
this, three and a half million men and women are directly
engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on
military security alone more than the net income of all
United States corporations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new in the American
experience. The total influence &amp;#x2013; economic, political, even
spiritual &amp;#x2013;is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every
office of the Federal government. We recognize the
imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail
to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources,
and livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of
our society.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the councils of government, we must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential
for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will
persist. We must never let the weight of this combination
endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should
take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable
citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge
industrial and military machinery of defense with our
peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may
prosper together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The purpose of the &lt;b&gt;Long Range Foundation&lt;/b&gt; seems, on the
surface, to be much the same as Lewin's proposals to dump
huge amounts of money into projects which will have no
practical return on investment.  But in fact, as Heinlein
points out, the ROI from such projects is potentially
enormous.  Where war truly is a means of throwing away
money, big projects seeking to solve big ideas will often
lead to very substantial payoffs.  Just not for the
generation which initiates them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a message that needs to be relearned.  We need to
make the distinction between investment whose only purpose
is to prop up power structures that are reaching the end of
their shelf life and big investments in the future that have
a real payoff.  This could form the foundation for a 
Nation State which is not based on fear and phantom enemies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some things take time.  Sometimes a very long time.  But the
potential payoff that your grandchildren or perhaps great
great great grandchildren will see is very real.  And it is
our responsibility to lay the groundwork for those who come
after we as individuals have passed out of living memory.
Bread cast upon the waters indeed.
